    <p>Also known as Captain America managed to remain frozen in the ice for several decades prior to being revived in the modern era. At the end of Captain America: The First Avenger, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) defeated the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving), but his victory came at a great cost; he was forced to crash the ship off the coast of Greenland. After a few last words to Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), Steve was presumably killed and mourned by Peggy, the Howling Commandos, and other people in America who looked up to him.</p>
